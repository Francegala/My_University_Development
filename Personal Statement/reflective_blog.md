Here we are, very close to the end of the first year of university.

Computer Science, after all the best choice I could have done, it is both a good school for coding and for all the other activities related to computing that are not coding such as Software Engineering because In the working world coding is not the only skill required.

This year the main programming language I learnt has been Java, in fact after all the hours of lectures I attended, I've successfully done 10 exercises for programming 1 and 10 for programming 2 and 3 projects that I'm thinking about putting in my portfolio for projects even if they are just simply coursework.

Fortunately, I've also learned another programming language: Assembly.

The first semester I studied computer architecture with the raspberry pi and it was my favourite subject because I learned what there is "behind the scene" of every piece of technology and even some historical facts. That's good because having a background is the best way to be prepared to face up to different kinds of challenges.

In semester 2 I started learning Assembly language using the raspberry pi. It was exciting because I didn't know anything about it before and it helped my critical thinking indeed when I wrote the code for the coursework, I needed to think about every problem from a range perspective.

It was also useful to understand how the gates and the hardware part I learnt first worked.

In these months at the university, I understood that here all is focused on problem-solving.

For every coursework, I need to do a lot of research in books and on the web to find the best ways to do the work to integrate with lectures notes and with the help of the demonstrators. So, I don't need only to learn the theory but what's good is that I'm learning how to do what I'm studying practically.

All the skills I'm acquiring are useful for my working future and are not only relatable to coding indeed I practice a lot of social skills. For example, for the video project, I practised my language skill. In the video I interviewed a girl, I would never have thought of doing such a thing in English before. It has been pretty hard because the topic was academic and not every day, but it was my first time it was even amusing. This second semester I've also done for the first time a literature review of Human-Computer Interaction and then I learnt some basics of how research works and how to find good and right sources and how to combine the work that people have already done with the one researcher is still doing using literacy information with my critical thinking to evaluate and synthesise opinions and ideas.

I also practised my communication skills in the everyday life during lectures, during teamwork indeed I helped to organise the meeting for the group and divide the work and I also helped record the audio aspect for the interview we took with my phone that we are using to synchronize with the video to have a better result.
