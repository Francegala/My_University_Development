Staying away from home, every situation is an attempt to take me out of my comfort zone trying to learn as much as possible from the culture of this foreign country.
This is a very international city and I have proved it by myself making friends with people from all around the world, I met people from the United Kingdom first, then from all the Europe, from Spain, France, Germany, Greece even from my home country I keep in touch with Italian people and I made friends with so many guys from Asia.
I love sharing their habits, uses and costumes.
For example, I cooked them some typical Italian dishes and they in return cooked me some of their typical dishes.
This international city is perfect for students because hosting more than one university it is possible to find peers and people of my same age and share passions and hobbies. 
This city offers so many activities inside the uni through the student union, all the societies and sports clubs. There are so many pubs and bars to go to spend a good time drinking a cappuccino or a beer. 
Newcastle is a human-size city big but not too much to be as busy as it could be in cities like London or Manchester and compared to other cities it doesn't rain too much.
For student life, it is perfect because there is a huge availability of student accommodation all along the city with different prices and all the living costs are affordable.
The university is spread through the city from the library to your campus and even if you have your campus for your degree like the USB for computing you will have the chance to visit other buildings on the campus because will be doing exams elsewhere or for other activities. 
This city is also really beautiful and good for tourism, there are so many sports events, concerts and festivals and also attractions, and monuments.
For all the people who want active nightlife, there are so many clubs for every taste.
There is the river the Tyne and it is romantic having a walk there cross the bridge during the night or go to one of the restaurants alongside the river.
There are many restaurants with typical food from all around the world, tapas or Chinese and Japanese, sushi, Italian or simply a hamburger from the classy ones to the cheap ones.
The accent is quite strong but people are so friendly when you meet someone while you're walking or if you need help at the shop people always smile at you.
There is a metro service to help people to cross the city with no difficulties. I love walking or using the Uber taxi service but I often use the metro to reach the airport.
So, in the end, this city offers you everything you could look for.





This period at the university has been the most challenging so far but the university assists you in doing everything you have to.
I am lucky to have been allowed to study in one of the most prestigious universities in the UK, founded in 1834 it has a huge range of courses.
I would recommend my university to all the students who would like to be part of an international and involving environment. 
there are not only students from all around the world but You can start even an international career because Newcastle University has campuses in Newcastle London, Singapore and Malaysia.
You never feel alone: when a student arrives for the first day, they can already feel that the university is not only made of staff and professors but also of all the peers all around ready to help and even assist them to reach their room in one of the student accommodations.
Newcastle University not only offers you lectures and university-related activities but there is a good student union organising so many events for example I started playing chess by joining the chess society and since I joined the computing society (NUCATS) I took part in a competition to win a Google home mini and I placed second.
Participating in societies or clubs is the best way to practice sports or to gain new skills useful for the future.
You receive assistance for every need and if at the beginning you don't feel too much comfortable asking for help, the university helps you by assigning you to a peer mentor, another student in a second year to give you all the information needed about money, time management or health care.
I registered at the university and GP service, which is a great service because it works differently compared to my country and I would have needed to spend a lot more time on that had I needed to register on my own. Then I opened a bank account too, choosing between all the different plans considering what all the banks could offer me.
If the student isn't too comfortable with the English language, the university offers languages courses to improve speaking, fluency and even writing and presentation skills or if you want to boost your languages skills instead, you can go to the language resource centre and ask for other languages lessons including Japanese.
I've already started to look for a job and a company for the year placement, and I also attended the Develop Your Professional Skills sessions and the lesson organised by NUCATS on how to develop an app with Android Studio.
The career service offers you help with writing your CV and a cover letter setting up courses to teach you all the bases and also practising for interviews or applying for a placement or a job.
I am studying for a degree in computing. I will spend a year on placement between Stages 2 and 3 to end the studies with specialist modules such as computer games development. 
I am very lucky to be given this opportunity because it is boosting my career and not all university offers you a similar possibility, for example, none of the unis in my home country has something similar.
To make the best of your days at university you have to exit from your comfort zone, it's not easy but rewarding.
Taking a degree in Computer Science at this university is the best choice I could have made because I am practising some of the most required skills in the working environment and every module is focused on all their possible industrial aspect.
Only by trying your hand at writing codes or creating a simple application, you can understand how important is studying for an IT degree.
