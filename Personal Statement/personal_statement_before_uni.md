As far as I can remember I have always been inspired to look to the future and enthusiastic about new scientific and technological progress in every field, mainly in the Internet of things (IoT) used in domotics, health and in daily life.

My first Personal Computer ran basic Windows '98 software with the first CD-Rom games.

At the age of twelve, I received my own All-In-One PC with Windows Vista, which I used for my first attempts at programming.

I began with simple web-based programming, writing a few lines of code in the developing forums and then I started to create amusing websites in which I described my gaming experiences with friends.

I enjoyed gaming so much that I decided to try and invent a personal game world through a simple drag-and-drop using RPG Maker.

When I was thirteen years old I began an extracurricular computer course at school. I was introduced to HTML programming from the basics to the creation of a web page, personalized with CSS and JavaScript.

When choosing which secondary school to attend I decided on a high school specializing in scientific subjects to focus on mathematics, algebra and physics. In particular, I selected the IT stream that included computer-oriented problem-solving. I am very satisfied with my choice because I have found both the environment and syllabus challenging but rewarding. I am studying C++ programming language and I have completed the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) course.

Last year I had the chance to do a month-long internship at Red Frog Digital, a company based in Manchester that specialised in the development of Augmented Reality Applications. It was an excellent opportunity to discover the world of object-oriented programming, game design and development.

I understand the division of tasks and the level of teamwork that is necessary to create a high-quality finished product made up of numerous, all equally important, components from the animation to the code behind the game itself.

During this period I used Unity 3D exclusively and achieved an intermediate level of knowledge that encouraged me to follow several online courses on YouTube and other platforms such as Udemy.

I tried to create and animate objects and characters before placing them in a first-person shooter game using the ray casting technique.

At that moment I decided that this would be my future, creating my universe through several lines of code, a gaming utopia or dystopia.

I chose to do my internship in the UK because this country has always fascinated me.

I started to travel as a teenager, attending summer language courses in Bedales and Bath in 2011-12; I also followed a course at the Liverpool School of English four years ago.

During my fourth year of high school, I took part in an exchange program, first hosting an Australian student in my home and then travelling to Wollongong NSW to attend the local college for three weeks.

This experience showed me different customs and traditions.

I love travelling and studying, I feel cosmopolitan and that the world is my home.

My most recent trip was another language course in Dublin last summer.

I have had a positive school career during which I have participated in many activities such as school open days, science Olympics, IT Olympics and theatre classes.

I obtained my First Certificate in English in April 2016 and I am currently preparing for the IELTS Academic certificate. I also passed the Diplôme d'études en Langue Française (DELF) certificate in French.

I enjoy several hobbies including chess and playing the piano as well as sailing.

I am keen on sci-fi series and in my spare time, I study software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects and Sony Vegas Pro.

I am interested in studying Game Development at university as it is a subject I am passionate about and I envision my future career in this field, creating new technologies. I consider games to be a form of intergenerational entertainment that can also teach values like teamwork and fair play.
