**HCI: How computing could help people with dementia and their caregivers.**

Dementia is a brain disease that affects a person's daily functioning due to the decrease in the ability to think and remember. (Riley, 2007m )

Even if the consciousness is not affected, its symptoms include emotional problems and problems with language resulting in decrease in motivation, so people with dementia can become socially isolated, deprived of all the variety of everyday life social interactions since they depend on a working short-term memory for effective participation. (Alm et al., 2002)

Deficits in planning and sequencing increase the needs for help when carrying out everyday tasks such as preparing food, washing oneself, cleaning or taking medication.

A possible assistance could be giving simple suggestions, but the problem is providing the cue at appropriate time because for example prompting someone to turn on the tap when they have already done so could be confusing.

There is a large amount of non-technological approaches to help with visual cues such as flowcharts and calendars to schedule activities or remember likely places to find lost objects. On the other hand, using technology, an electronic calendar could show date and time or at night, screens could present a clock along with a message reminding it is time to go to bed.

People with dementia are concerned about the everyday living actions such as using the telephone or operating the television or activities including cleaning, ironing and washing-up.

While dressing, they often require help in selecting appropriate items because they may put on more than one item of same thing.

A technological response would be to monitor the process of getting dressed and making the critical item of clothing the only one that is visible.

Another difficult problem to solve for people with cognitive problems is medication that it is also the major concern of the professional caregivers.

There are commercial products that make pills available only at the right time but in this case, pervasive computing techniques could be used to monitor the daily activity of the person and learn when medication prompting is most likely to be effective. (Wherton and Monk, 2008)

Sometimes family caregivers find assisting their loved ones to be particularly embarrassing as it necessitates invasion of privacy.

In response to the needs, a new way of prompting could be achieved using artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically monitor an older adult during a self-care activity.

'Cognitive Orthosis for Assisting aCtivities in the Home' (COACH) was developed to guide a user while washing their hands.

It uses four integrated systems: the tracking (for the position of the user's hands), state monitoring (which determines which step the person is completing), Markov decision process (MDP) policy (a type of AI technique), and prompting modules if the user became stuck at a step. (Mihailidis et al., 2007)

Difficulties in daily activities may trigger the need for personal assistance or a relocation to residential care setting. An inability to carry out multi-step tasks is associated with a poor self-esteem, anxiety and social isolation.

Performing daily activities in the familiar environment of their own home is important to people with dementia because of the health implications and their relationship to self-esteem and a sense of control.

Computer vision algorithms make it possible to detect where someone is and what they are doing. RFID tags allow everyday objects such as cups and utensils to be labelled and then located. While cooking, for example, data from sensors can then be used to infer what someone is doing and when they are not progressing through the task by manipulating the environmental context e.g. making clearly visible only the objects relevant to the task in hand.

The best way to help research in this field is to inform the design of future pervasive computing solutions for people with dementia doing everyday task in the home, in this particular case in the participants' own kitchens.

In Wherton and Monk analysis, if the participant appeared uncomfortable or distressed at any stage, the researcher would assist them. The researcher would also intervene at any point, where the participants could be at risk of harming themselves.

Participants were prompted when they were judged by the researcher not to have performed any actions for more than 5s or to have taken actions that prevent them from accomplishing the end goal.

They were also prompt when they asked directly for help.

All of these problems could possibly have been prevented with implicit prompts but would require explicit prompting to recover from once they had occurred.

In an automated system, implicit prompts might take the form of flashing lights or sounds.

The system needs to intervene using displays and actuators in order to provide system responses, for example, switching off the power. Displays could include central displays for spoken and visual prompts and wireless situated cross-modal devices located on or close to objects, to direct attention using small unit that could flash and emit a sound.

A possible argument against the use of implicit prompts is that a flashing light could overwhelm someone with dementia. (Wherton and Monk, 2010)

There is no known cure for dementia but it is possible to improve quality of life through musical creativity, investigating how technology could support creative music making for people with dementia.

Philippa Riley (Riley, 2007) conducted an experiment with chord playing using music to portray emotions.

As people with dementia are prone to difficulties with communication, a tool could also be useful for self-expression.

An intuitive interface prompts users to interact with the tool using a touch screen then chords will play portraying the emotion selected and providing visual feedback too.

Basic melodies can be created by dragging a finger up and down the screen, with more complex pieces created by touching different parts of the screen. (Riley, 2007)

Dementia also has a significant effect on the person's caregivers but advancing technology may offer ways to supplement human care.

For example, Carer is an app developed to support staff, based on the application of knowledge about previous similar episodes of challenging behaviour.

This app was implemented on an iPod Touch in which staff enter the details of the encountered behaviour then refines it by selecting one of the observed behaviour values such as 'Resident is violent'.

Then it displays to the carer the three most similar retrieved case studies with the possibility to read the details of each one and how the problem was solved by clicking on it in order to apply knowledge and to manage challenging behaviour. (Zachos et al., 2011)
