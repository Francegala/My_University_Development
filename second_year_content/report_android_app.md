In this report, I will describe all the steps I did with my teammates to create a good team and a friendly environment to produce a great Android app following specifications as if the final product would it be for a client. I am also reflecting on all the skills I improved and what I liked and disliked.
I took part in a random team with some guys I already knew from stage one projects and coursework and with others I didn’t. We have been presented with some different specifications of projects of various apps. My team opted for the app on the tour of the computing campus. Then the project development started with the concept development, thinking about the design, creating a draft of the design of how it would look and planning the code building a feature at a time. When we were ideating the functionalities, at first, I used my leadership skills to propose an AR version of the app because I know how to create AR Apps and I thought that adding graphical content could have been a great idea and my team accepted. Unfortunately, we had not enough time to add all the desired features as the app was more difficult to develop than we thought so we decided not to continue adding all the features. The main aim of the app is to aid users to take a tour of the campus receiving directions shown on the GUI using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, allowing the user to look up room details or to receive directions via the lift or stairs according to their decision. We decided to develop the app as if it could have been reused to be the guide of another building a sort of general-purpose tour so just adding all the data related to the building, all the information to be displayed to a database. The app gathers the data from the database and then shows them on the app. The algorithm also uses the nodes stored in the database to create the shortest path. The images of the room and content added rather than of the AR feature are all pics stored online using one of the services where you can host photos and share links. I decided to store the link on the database to get the images to show using one of the dependencies getting the URL from a table on the database and then showing the jpeg. I did that because of a previous project I did during which I learnt that it is good practice to store a link to the photo rather than the pic itself as it could be very heavy.
We decided to split the team into a front-end part of a team, back end and a little part of the team that would have worked on the written matter, mainly concerning the documentation. I decided to join the backend team as I thought it could have been the best to use my passion and expertise to write code in Java, a programming language I have been studying for a couple of years and produce with the team a high-quality product. The back end had to think about all the details of the system to be implemented, understanding the needs of the customer and the system as the app to be developed would be run on Android devices. The only problem is that we had to use android studio to develop the app as to develop an app there is not so much choice, but we weren’t taught how to use Android Studio. To deepen and increase our skills, we thought to use Kotlin instead of Java to develop the app as it is a simplified and improved programming language based on and like Java. After spending time reasoning about it we decided not to continue with the choice of using another programming language as we could have been some problems troubleshooting errors or finding help and hints if needed. 
For me it wasn’t the first time I encounter the need to develop an app; in fact, I have used Android Studio before but at an entry level so I only knew a little about its interface shortcuts, where to look for the debugger, to build and run the app, to export the ‘APK’, where to write dependencies and how the ‘activities’ worked. Android Studio uses Java as a programming language which allows us to use objects but one of the biggest difficulties I encountered is that Android Studio uses some definitions, and some classes to interact with the Android OS, with the mobile phone, with the app itself or different apps that are not commonly known or used and sometimes it lacks documentation or the only one available is the official one that could be not very targeted to beginners. Fortunately, I found some tutorials on YouTube to view whenever I felt lost. It happened that I felt lost as I had to use Android Studio on such an advanced level, as the app was very challenging, with no lectures, any suggestion on where to start or guide provided and that was for me a positive experience as it helped my enterprise skill learning to take advantage of opportunities, to improve myself on a certain situation. I mastered my skill to adapt to difficulties, and to think of new ways of approaching each task for every deliverable. On the other hand, it was also a negative experience as the version of the software on the PCs of the university was so obsolete that wasn’t possible to develop there. It helped me focus on my initiative to find a way to program without being prompted by others. I only ticketed the IT service to ask for help but first they told me that they could update one of the computers I was using but then they said they could not. So, I had to rely on my independence to achieve goals even if my laptop wasn’t performing enough for the Android Studio which require a huge amount of RAM thanks to my adaptability and my problem-solving skill, I overcome a such difficult situation. If I should do the project again, I would require the university to provide me with the least up-to-date version of the program. Another negative experience has been with GitLab. Gitlab is a fundamental tool for version controlling and it is very important for working alongside a team but the one provided by the university was outdated same as the version of Android Studio. So overall, I think that the experience of learning how to develop an app should be included in the full computer scientist background, but the university must provide the most up-to-date software.
This experience helped me learn about myself, enhancing my employability and my skills because I have also used tools such as the Gantt chart putting into practice what studied during semester one lectures on software engineering modules having team deadlines for the project like a real job. I also improved my self-awareness and ability to self-manage and interact as part of a team applying teamwork, programming skills and knowledge in a work-related context. That for me was a positive experience because it is work-related learning, a real example of working with a client and how it would be working in the software industry so organising meeting as we did to show them progresses, listen to feedback or ask for information and suggestions and trying to improve. It was well-defined coursework, a simulation of full immersion in agile methodology with scrums and meetings with the team to know what they are working on, to share difficulties and goals and to motivate other members and to share knowledge to help those who had difficulties. Sometimes the meetings were annoying as they were fixed in the week and sometimes it happen that more flexibility was required for example one day I was off for an assessment day or another time I had a job interview and these events didn’t allow me to take part in all the meetings. I think that it could be good to give teams more flexibility on the mandatory meetings because I think it’s important to be present for example sometimes, I had to ask the lecturer for some help if I didn’t understand something.
I not only did coding, but I also worked on producing the documentation even if writing is not my cup of tea. This Experience started as a proper job, I wrote with my team the contract and the project plan writing about the division of duties with the description of the app, adding possible features and a raw graphical aspect. When I wrote the team contract, it was the first time I faced the need to write a real contract and think about what to include following some standards and protocols describing all the duties and all the needs. I did other paperwork too and that helped me with my information literacy skills learning how to find information using paper and electronic resources, elaborating them and critical thinking as the documentation I wrote made me consider issues and information from a range of perspectives, drawing upon relevant information and data synthesis to present everything I researched and wrote on int correct written format. I contributed to the project plan, the plan about how the project is broken down listing the task to be completed to have a product to present to the client showing the details of the system to be implemented. We also did a peer review and it has been a good opportunity to know what others thought about my work and to take notes on how to improve my active learning and myself taking responsibility for my learning to fulfil potential. I took part in the presentation during the Dragon’s Den presenting the ideas behind the application to a panel composed of industrial and/or academic representations. The app wasn’t fully implemented but to show our ideas, I helped my team to prepare a PowerPoint Presentation to cover technologies we used, underlying algorithms and draft UI designs. I also answered a couple of questions about the database as I already had a base knowledge of it because I used it even before starting the database module and then I decided I would have preferred joining the back-end team and developing the database for the app. To answer questions, I talked in front of multiple people improving my presentation skills, one of the most required skills in the industry. I knew the answers because of some previous personal projects I started to deepen my knowledge about databases and improve my skill. I am very glad I helped my team answer using my background as they didn’t know how to answer. The question was how to store images as their dimensions could be a size problem for the database and as I already wrote above, I posted them online on an image host website and then saved the link.
I decided to take care of databases as I thought it could have been a good opportunity to put together the knowledge and expertise of two different modules (Software Engineering and Databases) and research both to know how to deepen my knowledge and improve my skill of a full stack developer. First I created an SQLite Database using DB Browser (SQLite) then inserting all the data took me so much because as more as time was passing, it happened that content was to be changed or the format of the single data needed was different or the type of data or the data itself that wasn’t correct so it was to change. Then I spent another huge amount of time figuring out how to connect the database to the app and make it possible to get or insert data and interact with it. I was in trouble as the official documentation wasn’t clear enough and no guide or tutorial could have applied to my project because outdated or too much linked to every single example. Then when I figure it out with the help of some teammates, I decided to create a sort of guide, a reference for the team to give them the possibility to understand what I did and how to replicate or interact with the database. I thought it was fundamental to write something that teammates could use as help if they needed help and that helped me with both personal and social skills than skills such as correct writing, documenting and guiding my colleagues. Another great challenge was creating nodes using a map given from the front end as I had to create nodes for lifts for rooms and stairs and sometimes it happened that the plants that they gave me were not completed or with some errors. It was also challenging adapting the database to the needs of the other teammates to allow them to create classes and methods with the data from the database and on the other hand populating the database with the data given by other’s people work. The main purpose of the database is to store floor plans, rooms, location (x, y), photos of rooms, which staff or tutor works in which room, information about staff and rooms and nodes with edges for the algorithm. Thanks to the abstraction the interaction with the database should have been only during the development period without the need of the user to interact with it and even know that behind the app there is a complex database. Before creating the actual working database, I implemented the database graph and it was challenging because I had to use what I learnt from another module of software engineering to create the graph for both the software side and architecture aspect but it has been rewarding as the database created with that model worked fine. As we are using a relational database, the diagram I designed showed the different tables and their corresponding attributes holding data of rooms, nodes, multimedia and staff depicting the relationship between tables and how they link with one another.
As the database provided data to be used by other colleagues, I worked alongside the entire back end and initially I paired with another teammate to know better how to use android studio so we followed tutorials together to join works using the git bash setting and achieving shared goals improving each other teamworking skills. I built a strong relationship with my teammates supporting each other, helping them and maintaining connections even outside working hours just to know each other better, sharing ideas and building trust. I have been meeting more often with one colleague in particular to work together on some aspect of the app as his work is about creating nodes to use for Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using data from the database. He was building Objects factories for the rooms, floors and all the objects related to the nodes and I am providing scripts to use to get data from the database using SQL Queries and to connect to the database. To use Dijkstra’s algorithm, nodes for rooms were needed. Each floor has a graph with a set of nodes and edges and to use them, data from the database are fetched. I also interacted with the front end as I fixed some errors of design about the maps to be displayed that were missing some important parts such as lifts, stairs or restricted areas. I also used some new dependencies for the app as ‘Picasso’ that allows displaying images from the web as they were too heavy for the database I decided to upload them online and store in the database only the link allowing the app to be reused or adapted for other maps, other buildings and other clients. I also practised leadership skills even if I am not the group leader taking responsibility for important choices as described above. I also encouraged my team and directed them to take some developing decisions on what tool to use and reflect on what is the best thing to do if in doubt. I worked on the testing and reliability of the app fixing bugs and solving problems too. I decided to work for the backend even if my favourite modules and topics are web design and development, I wanted to try graphical software, and design methodologies, as I wanted to challenge myself at working within new environments. To do so I helped develop the tests to prove the correctness of the method and classes implemented, making them fail to know what could be wrong and then cover all the error cases to handle possible misuses of the app and making them pass to be sure everything is done correctly. We also did the A1 size portrait poster needed for the trade fair and I helped review the work done and implemented a little section working with Photoshop about the features of the app.
